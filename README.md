## BitCoin Prediction Model with Historical and Current Year Graphical Plots

- 📊 **Graphical Representation**: The model showcases **graphical plots** of historical years and includes predictions for the **current year**. A sample plot image is provided to visualize the prediction trends over time.

- 🛠️ **Libraries Used**:
    - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
    - **NumPy**: To handle numerical computations.
    - **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for model building and splitting the dataset using `train_test_split`.
    - **Linear Regression**: The core algorithm to predict Bitcoin prices.
    - **Matplotlib**: For plotting the graphical representation of the prediction model.
    - **Requests**: To fetch external data as needed for the model.

- 💻 **Installation**: To get started, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib requests
